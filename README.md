### 1) HW1 Struct html

Create a structure to store information about an HTML tag: its name, the ?open/close? And
tag attributes. Using it, write a program that includes a function that takes as input
a text string with one tag. At the output, the function must return a pointer to the initialized structure.

### 2) HW2 Processes algo

Compare and print to the console the running time of serial and parallel using
several processes of algorithms, each of which allocates a character array in dynamic memory
100 Mb in size and, considering its content as an abstract correspondence, determines
emotional coloring of the latter. Correspondence is considered optimistic if there are more digraphs `:)` in it,
than digraphs `:(`, otherwise the correspondence is considered pessimistic.

#### Outcome: ####

476 times faster in parallel implementation (Mac 2017 2.3 GHz 2-core Intel Core i5)

<pre>
Consistent algorithm time: 0.556757
Parallel algorithm time: 0.001069
Emotional color positive
